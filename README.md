The frontend is located in the gardarobeApp and the backend is located in backend

Need to run backend and frontend at the same time.

We use dotenv to store keys and other stuff. This is not uploaded to github

To test payment use card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 and then any valid information on the rest.

Need two phones to run both as a user and as a host. Host need specific logins. Host Login - mail: barkowski@host.dk - password: 111111
To test the host, the user need to get tickets at the same lokation as the hosts lokation. (barkowski host = barkowski bar)
